# Alternatives

Some alternatives to docsify are Jekyll, and 11ty. More sligtly different alternatives are grav, wordpress, and drupul. 

### Word Press
Word press is the most popular cms of the ones listed above. It is said that 40% of the web is built on WordPress. You can start building a wordpress site [here](https://wordpress.com/).

### Drupul
Drupul is another popular and powerful content management system. You can read more about drupal [here](https://www.drupal.org/).

### Grav
I actully started this assignment using grav. After trying to use it for about 2 hours I gave up and found docsify much easier. (I deffinatly could have been doing it wrong). If you want to try grav for yourself visit this site [here](https://getgrav.org/).
