# Docsify 


Docsify is a content management system that parses markdown files and creates a website from them. It is very simply to use and can be a very powerful tool. The documentation is extremly thourgh and should answer any questions you have. Unlike content management systems like grav, docsify is static. Docsify uses the file structure of the project as a pattern.

The docsify community uses a discord server to share ideas. You can join the server [here](https://discord.com/invite/3NwKFyR).

In this project I used Docsify to create a site and github pages to deploy it. You can get started with docsify [here](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart), and you can get started with github pages [here](https://pages.github.com/).
