# Pro's and Con's 

### Some Pro's to using Docsify

* Using docsify simplifies the process of creating a complete website. 
* Markdown is easier to learn than typical languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
* It is very easy to set up if you have any npm and command line experience. Even if you didn't have any experience I beleive it would be possible to install the dependecies and run the site locally. 
* The project exists in a folder and therefore you have the whole site
* You can change the entire theme of the site by changing one line i.e. linking to an external stylesheet

### Some Con's to using Docsify

* Using a cms could mean your webpage is not as unique if you choose to use premade themes. 
* Using a cms also limits the amount you can customize your webpage. 
* Can not use Liquid tags made from ruby.. therefore cannnot embed youtube videos etc. 
* Could be diffciult to get started if you dont have npm and a textediotr installed on your computer
* Does not allow for users or require a login
