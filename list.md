# Pro's and Con's 

### Pro's

* Using docsify simplifies the process of creating a complete website. 
* Markdown is easier to learn than typical languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
* It is very easy to set up if you have any npm and command line experience. Even if you didn't have any experience I beleive it would be possible to install the dependecies and run the site locally. 
* Does not statically build html files
* You can change the entire theme of the site by changing one line i.e. linking to an external stylesheet

### Con's 

* Using a cms could mean your webpage is not as unique if you choose to use premade themes. 
* Using a cms also limits the amount you can customize your webpage.
